    #- errchkjson # [don't see profit + I'm against of omitting errors like in the first example https://github.com/breml/errchkjson] checks types passed to the json encoding functions. Reports unsupported types and optionally reports occasions, where the check for the returned error can be omitted
    #- forcetypeassert # [replaced by errcheck] finds forced type assertions
